# polyglot
TamperMonkey user script which improves user experience with Codewars (or at least tries to).


WHAT IS IT?
-----------
 This piece of code is a Tampermonkey user script which provides some
 additional per-language filtering and display capabilities,
 effectively making it easier for you to obtain POLYGLOT badge.

WHERE CAN I DOWNLOAD IT FROM?
-----------------------------
 You can get the script [here](https://github.com/hobovsky/polyglot/releases/latest/download/polyglot.js).

 HOW TO INSTALL IT?
------------------
 - Install Tampermonkey extension for your browser,
 - Copy&paste the script to your scripts library.

 WHAT FEATURES DOES IT PROVIDE?
------------------------------
 - You can copy content of code boxes into clipboard.
 - "Spoiler" flags are visible all the time and do not dis/re-appear
   in a very annoying manner.
 - Contents of "Solutions" and "Past solutions" views are displayed in
   tabs by language.
 - Leaderboards: "Solved kata is default leaderboard (since "Overall"
   ranking does not measure anything useful). Also, leaderboards are
   automatically scrolled to show your score.
 - Beta kata: uses Codwewars API to fetch and present breakdown of rank votes.

 HOW TO UNINSTALL IT?
--------------------
 I haven't checked.

 KNOWN ISSUES
------------
 - Yes.
 - A race condition here or there.
 - Selectors, hooks and listeners used are so inefficient that your local power
   plant probably doubles its coal consumption.

 WHAT CAN I DO WITH THE SCRIPT?
------------------------------
 - You are allowed to use it, unless someone authoritative (CW staff?) says you can't.
 - You can modify it ONLY IF your modifications are going to bring any improvement
   into the way it works, AND you are going to share improved version with CW community.
 - You can send all your critical remarks to `/dev/null`, unless it's something I could
   learn or otherwise benefit from - in such case, you can contact me on Codewars
   Discord server.

 THIS CODE IS CRAP, LOOKS LIKE CRAP, AND WORKS LIKE CRAP! WHY?
-------------------------------------------------------------
 I am really sorry if this code hurts your eyes, brain, or feelings
 in any way, but I am not a professional HTML developer and each and
 every technique present here (JavaScript, jQuery, TamperMonkey,
 CW API) I've used for the first time.
